# Test Subjects and Specifications

This folder contains the API artifacts and configurations used in our experiments.

â”œâ”€â”€ java8.env          # Shell environment for running APIs with Java 8
â”œâ”€â”€ java11.env         # Shell environment for running APIs with Java 11
â”œâ”€â”€ java17.env         # Shell environment for running APIs with Java 17
â””â”€â”€ setup.sh           # One-click script to set up the API services and environments

```

## Set Up 
1. **Edit the Java environment files**: Update the java8.env, java11.env, and java17.env files to correctly export the JAVA_HOME path on your system.
For example, in `java8.env`:
    ```bash
    export JAVA_HOME=/path/to/jdk1.8.0_361
    export PATH=$JAVA_HOME/bin:$PATH
    ```

2. Make the `setup.sh` script executable and run it:

```bash
chmod +x setup.sh
./setup.sh
```

This will build and configure the necessary API services and ensure that the environment variables are properly sourced.
